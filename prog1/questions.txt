1. The result is the same. However, when input is passed through from a file, there is no newline after the program prompts for an input.
2. Any edge cases would be where the user inputs anything that is not an integer. Due to how `scanf` works, there wouldn't be a runtime error, but the result wouldn't be logically accurate. For example, any floating point value would simply be treated as an integer, ignoring the decimal part. Inputting a string would result in '0' being used as the input, leading to -SUBTRACTION_CONSTANT as the result.
3. Some useful unit tests would be to test the 'calculate' part of the program. Since this is such a basic program, I did not make a separate function to do the calculate, but in a more real world context, where the calculation is non-trivial, it would be useful to set up a unit test to ensure it works as intended. Another unit test could be to check if the input is correctly being scanned in.
